The project starts from a simple idea: MNIST is not the objective, but the vehicle for studying how a heterogeneous SoC behaves under a deterministic compute pipeline. The Zynq-7000 exposes a boundary between software and hardware that becomes meaningful only when the system is forced to operate under tight numeric guarantees. The goal is therefore not model accuracy but shaping a controlled path from the PS to the PL and back, revealing how data, timing and arithmetic interact across that boundary.

The first assumption was that most of the work belongs inside the PL. If the compute fabric is structured in a predictable way and weight storage remains local, then the PS contributions should degrade to mere orchestration. This implies the accelerator should not rely on the PS for intermediate computations, normalization, or adaptive behaviour. It receives a tensor, executes the full inference, and emits logits without ambiguity.

Another early hypothesis concerned bandwidth. The DMA interface was expected to contribute a non–negligible share of the total latency, but still far smaller than the accumulation effort in the first fully-connected layer. This motivated a view of the design where the PL is compute-bound and the AXI paths serve as clean, burst-friendly transport layers.

These hypotheses created the constraints that drive the rest of the system: fixed INT8 tensors; fixed INT32 accumulators; a quantization pipeline whose parameters are computed offline; no dynamic ranges computed in hardware; and complete isolation from external memory during compute. Determinism is the central theme. The design should behave the same way on every run, with no hidden floating-point behaviour, no runtime calibration, and no implicit arithmetic inside the accelerator.

This document anchors the initial vision. Everything that follows: the calibration stage, the quantization scripts, the engine microarchitecture and the layer-by-layer compute flow — emerges from these early assumptions about determinism, locality and the hierarchy between the PS and PL.
